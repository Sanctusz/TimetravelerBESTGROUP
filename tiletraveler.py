1. Which implementation was easier and why?
    Since it´s based on the first program. Making the second program was
    easier since we already solved the problem, we just improved our solution.
    One way to look at it is that the first program was a draft, an algorithm we could implement into our second program.

2. Which implementation is more readable and why?
    The second one, is a lot more readable because of the functions. 
    By sectioning the program, it becomes less intimidating and not as much of a clutter. 
    It can be hard for anyone other than the original programmers to read this kind of code since they would have to spend more time analyzing how it works. 

3. Which problems in the first implementations were you able to solve with the latter implementation?
    Beside the problem of overall readability, the new program makes it easier for us to make another similar program based on this one by using the functions. 
    We didn't have to repeat code that we already wrote to make it work.
