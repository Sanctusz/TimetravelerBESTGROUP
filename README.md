# TileTraveler

This is a school project written in Python. 

The project is to develop a computer game in which the player is located in a certain tile in
a grid. At each iteration, the program displays the directions for which there are adjacent tiles
that the player can travel to.

The program only displays text, so actually there is no drawn tile grids, but the program
behaves as if the player is in a 3x3 grid with open and closed walls. 

The player should use "N/n" for north, "S/s" for south, "E/e" for east and "W/w" for west to move the character. 

If the user can reach the final tile then we will have a WINNER! :) 

## Prerequisites

Python 3.* is required to run the game. 

## How to run the game
