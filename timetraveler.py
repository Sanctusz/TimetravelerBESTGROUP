You need to get to point 6 in the list.
You start at point 0.
When you go North you go up 1 slot in the list.
When you go East you go up 3 slots in the list.
When you go West you go down 3 slots in the list.
When you go South you go down 1 slot in the list.
There are walls which you can't go through.
If you try and go into a direction you can't go then you get an error.
Find your way through the maze.

N = +1
E = +3
